F is the total cost of the node.
G is the distance between the current node and the start node.
H is the heuristic — estimated distance from the current node to the end node.
Note: In the maze given below: '0' is free path and '1' is obstacle

##########Pseudocode:

// A* (star) Pathfinding
// Initialize both open and closed list
let the openList equal empty list of nodes
let the closedList equal empty list of nodes

// Add the start node
put the startNode on the openList (leave it's f at zero)

// Loop until you find the end
while the openList is not empty

    // Get the current node
    let the currentNode equal the node with the least f value
    remove the currentNode from the openList
    add the currentNode to the closedList
    
    // Found the goal
    if currentNode is the goal
        Backtrack to get path
    // Generate children
    let the children of the currentNode equal the adjacent nodes
    
    for each child in the children
        // Child is on the closedList
        if child is in the closedList
            continue to beginning of for loop
            
        // Create the f, g, and h values
        child.g = currentNode.g + distance between child and current
        child.h = distance from child to end
        child.f = child.g + child.h
        
        // Child is already in openList
        if child.position is in the openList's nodes positions
            if the child.g is higher than the openList node's g
                continue to beginning of for loop
                
        // Add the child to the openList
        add the child to the openList
