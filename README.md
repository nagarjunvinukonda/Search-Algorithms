# Search-Algorithms:
* Programming Search Algorithms namely BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A* and RRT* using Python

* Made simple implmentations with annoted explanation of planning algorithms.  

* Further I have worked on implementing A* search Algorithm on Open Street Map (OSM) using Io2D libraries and C++. 

# A* search on Open-Street Map:
